## Introduction

Rate Limiting API is designed to showcase the implementation of a Flask-based RESTful API. It allows users to generate random data of varying lengths and provides rate-limiting mechanisms to ensure fair usage. The API also includes authentication using JWT tokens for secure access.

## Features

- User authentication and JWT-based authorization for secure API access.
- Generate random data of custom lengths for various use cases.
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse and ensure fair usage of the API.
- Admin functionality to manage rate limits for users, maintaining control.
- Dockerized application for easy deployment and consistent environment setup.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9
- Docker (optional)

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd RateLimitingAPI
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Running the API

To run the API locally, follow these steps:

1. Make sure you're in the project directory.
2. Start the API server using the following command:
   ```bash
   python run.py
   ```
   The API will be accessible at `http://localhost:4000`.

### API Endpoints

#### Login

Endpoint: `POST /api/login`

This endpoint allows users to authenticate and obtain an access token for API access.

Request:
```json
{
  "username": "user1",
  "password": "password1"
}
```

Response:
```json
{
  "access_token": "your_access_token"
}
```

#### Generate Random Data

Endpoint: `GET /api/random`

This endpoint generates random data of the specified length.

Query Parameter:
- `len` (optional): Length of random data (default is 32)

Response:
```json
{
  "random": "generated_random_data"
}
```

#### Admin Rate Limit Management

Endpoint: `POST /api/admin/rate-limit`

This endpoint allows administrators to manage rate limits for users.

Request (Reset Rate Limit):
```json
{
  "client_username": "user1",
  "reset": true
}
```

Request (Set New Rate Limit):
```json
{
  "client_username": "user1",
  "new_limit": 2048
}
```

## Testing

To run the automated tests, execute the following command:

```bash
python -m unittest discover tests
```

## Assumptions and Design Decisions

- **JWT-Based Authorization:** I chose to use JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for user authentication and authorization due to their stateless nature and support for claims like user roles and permissions.

- **Rate Limiting Strategy:** To simplify the implementation, we used an in-memory dictionary for rate limiting. However, we acknowledge that this solution won't scale horizontally across multiple instances and recommend a distributed solution like Redis in production.

- **Logging and Error Handling:** I implemented logging to record important events such as login attempts and access to restricted routes. Error handling is comprehensive to provide users with meaningful error messages.

- The passwords in the `USERS_DB` are hashed using PBKDF2 for security.
- In-memory rate limiting is implemented for simplicity, but a distributed solution like Redis would be better for scalability.
- Users authenticate via the login endpoint to obtain a JWT token.
- Admin access is restricted using a predefined username (admin) in the JWT token.
- Rate limit management endpoints (/api/admin/rate-limit) are only accessible to the admin user.

## How to Build, Run, and Test

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install required dependencies (`pip3 install -r requirements.txt`).
3. Run the API using `python3 run.py`.
4. Use tools like `curl` or the `requests` library to test the endpoints.

## Rate Reset and Parallel Requests

- The rate limit resets every 10 seconds.
- Parallel requests from the same user share the rate limit window.
- Rate limits are enforced per user.

## State Management and Design Patterns

- In-memory `_rate_limit_store` is used to manage rate limit data.
- Singleton pattern is followed for the Flask app instance.
- JWT tokens are used to manage user sessions securely.

## Docker Containerization

The application can also be run within a Docker container. To build and run the container, follow these steps:

1. Make sure Docker is installed on your system.
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd RateLimitingAPI
   ```
3. Build the Docker image:
   ```bash
   docker build -t ratelimitingapi:latest .
   ```
4. Run the Docker container:
   ```bash
   docker run -p 4000:4000 ratelimitingapi:latest
   ```
   The API will be accessible at `http://localhost:4000`.
